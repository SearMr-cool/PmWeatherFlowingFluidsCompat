## What does this mod to?
This mod makes Protomanlyâ€™s Weather Compatible with the Flowing fluids Mod made by Traben (Rain from PmWeather affects Flowing fluids).

It achieves this by modifying some of Flowing Fluids base mixins but the overall functionality should not be affected.

  

## What has changed with Flowing Fluids?

This mod modifies 2 of Flowing Fluids mixins mostly just replacing vanilla rain checks with rain checks from PmWeather, however some things are affected by this mods config so some normal base functionality is disabled by default to enhance gameplay, one another thing to note is that draining chance is now a dynamic variable as if it is left static major constant lag can occur.

  

## Current Issues?

As of now I only know of one major issue which is the fact that when it stops raining a massive lag spike can occur for a couple seconds however there is an option to combat this issue however it will stop draining everywhere on the server anytime rain is detected so by default this is disabled as it can affect gameplay quite majorly.
